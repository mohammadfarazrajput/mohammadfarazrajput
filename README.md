## 💫 About Me

I’m a **BTech AI student** focused on building **real, production-style ML systems** — not just training models in notebooks.

I enjoy working close to the **engineering side of ML**: system design, trade-offs, debugging, and making things actually run end-to-end.

---

## 🔭 What I’m currently working on

Building **end-to-end ML systems**, most recently a  
🎬 **Hybrid Movie Recommendation System** combining:
- Content-Based Filtering  
- Item-Based Collaborative Filtering  
- Matrix Factorization (FunkSVD from scratch)  
- Live **Streamlit UI**

This project focuses on **system integration, modularity, and real-world constraints**.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on

Applied **AI/ML projects** involving:
- Recommendation systems  
- Data pipelines & feature engineering  
- GenAI / agent-based systems  
- Real-world problem solving (not toy notebooks)

---

## 🤝 I’m looking for help with

- Improving **ML system design & scalability**
- Better **evaluation strategies** for recommender systems
- Learning **production ML best practices** used in real teams

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- Advanced **Recommendation Systems**
- **ML Engineering** practices
- **Agent-based GenAI systems** (LangChain / LangGraph)

---

## 💬 Ask me about

- Hybrid recommender system design  
- Matrix factorization from scratch  
- Streamlit apps for ML systems  
- Debugging real-world ML pipelines

## ⚡ Fun fact

I enjoy building **full ML systems end-to-end** more than training a single model —  
and I often break things *on purpose* just to understand how they work 😄
